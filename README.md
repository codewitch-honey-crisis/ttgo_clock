# ttgo_clock

A retro digital clock that uses IP location services and NTP to keep time.

It was primarily designed for the TTGO T1 Display, but since then, I've added support for the M5 Stack Core 2, Tough, and (untested since mine broke) the S3 Atom. I've also added support for the Lilygo T5 4.7" E-paper device and the Heltek Wifi v2
